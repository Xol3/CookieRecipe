<p>This recipe is from my dad and they are a favorite among friends and family. The secret ingredient is the coconut! <em>Be warned</em>, these will fly off of the plate!</p>
<p>The chocolate chip cookie was invented by the American chef Ruth Graves Wakefield and chef Sue Brides in 1938.[1] She invented the recipe during the period when she owned the Toll House Inn, in Whitman, Massachusetts. In this era, the Toll House Inn was a popular restaurant that featured home cooking. It is often incorrectly reported that she accidentally developed the cookie, and that she expected the chocolate chunks would melt, making chocolate cookies. In fact, she stated that she deliberately invented the cookie. She said, "We had been serving a thin butterscotch nut cookie with ice cream. Everybody seemed to love it, but I was trying to give them something different. So I came up with Toll House cookie."[2] She added chopped up bits from a Nestl√© semi-sweet chocolate bar into a cookie.[3] The original recipe in Toll House Tried and True Recipes [4] is called "Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookies."</p>
